# Risk Register Template

Use this template to track and manage project risks. Review weekly during PM sync meetings and update as risks evolve.

## How to Use This Risk Register

1. **Identify risks** during project initiation, planning, and execution
2. **Assess impact and likelihood** using the scales below
3. **Assign owners** responsible for monitoring and mitigation
4. **Review weekly** in PM sync meetings
5. **Update status** as risks are mitigated, escalated, or closed
6. **Archive resolved risks** for retrospective review

### Impact Scale
- **Critical:** Project failure, major cost overrun, significant stakeholder impact
- **High:** Major delay, significant rework, key feature cut
- **Medium:** Minor delay, workaround required, some rework
- **Low:** Minimal impact, easily managed

### Likelihood Scale
- **Very Likely (>75%):** Almost certain to occur
- **Likely (50-75%):** Probable
- **Possible (25-50%):** May occur
- **Unlikely (<25%):** Low probability

## Notes & Guidelines

- Add new risks as soon as they are identified
- Be specific in risk descriptions (who, what, when, impact)
- Keep mitigation strategies actionable and time-bound
- Escalate risks that cannot be resolved at the team level
- Archive closed risks quarterly for historical reference
- Use this register in retrospectives to improve risk identification
